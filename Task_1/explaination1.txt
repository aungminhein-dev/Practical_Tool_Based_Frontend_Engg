Technologies : html + css


In this task, a simple web page is implemented using basic html semantics.

Texts in <h1></h1> tag is centerd with inline css named with "text-align" arrtibute with value "center".
eg : text-align:center

<p></p> is colored with inline css named with "color" arrtibute with value "#696666" which is a hex color code.
eg : color:#696666


I used inline css in the tags using style="${attribute:value}"
